# AnnouncementBuddy

## For users

## For developers
As a development team, we go by a universal standard so code becomes easy to edit. Things that will be used:
* GitHub (to manage code)
* Your IDE choice (for frontend I recommend [Brackets](https://brackets.io) and for backend, [Atom](https://atom.io))
* Javascript (along with jQuery, Node.js, and Electron.js), HTML/CSS, and SQLite

Along with tools, we have a universal style standard:
* 4 space indentions (for ease of use to transfer across IDEs)
* You can use tabs or spaces, but I recommend tabs

Finally, our deployment will be handled in this manner:
* Heroku manages backend management
* Heroku will pull from the GitHub repository


Have fun developing!
