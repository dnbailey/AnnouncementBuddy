# Contributing
As the main creators of this project, we have certain way we would like things to be done. Don't worry, it's nothing too outragous!
We will keep it simple and short.
## What features we need
Check the 'Projects' tab to review our user stories.
## Code structure
Our first request is that you do not restructure the app. If you think it will make it more efficent, submit a suggestion in the issues page
and we will review it. If we find it interesting, we will merge your pull request. 

## Code styling
For the sake of our developers, we ask you follow this styling guide:

1. 4 space tabs (yes, tabs). If it conflicts with our current style, we will reject it.
2. No unnecessary whitespace (It increases the file size)
3. No unnecessary comments. We get you want to document your part well, but please don't put things like '// this is a module'

As the project grows in size, we will change this so if something changes, please just accept it.

## Library imports
If you import a library and realize you do not need it, remove it. Make sure to include your update package.json file in the pull request
so there are no errors. Make sure you check the code of the library you are using before you import it. You can never be sure when
it comes to npm modules.

## Testing
Before you submit your pull request, please run tests to make sure it can stand up to use. 
## That's all
If you follow these simple guidelines, you will be able to contribute to this project.
